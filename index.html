						<p>For the past two years I've put my energy towards growing and 
						enhancing meaningful software. I then went one step futher when 
						I enrolled in PSTCC CSIT program. The course load in conjunction
						with taking online classes through MIT have provided me the assets 
						to contribute to any development company. What motivated me was the passion to produce and contribute great software. The more I've learned, the possibilities endless.</p>

					<p>"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it." - Steve Jobs</p>
